Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Basketball_stats

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
When playing basketball, it can be difficult to track progress from day to day without using a lot of repetitive math. This program will take user input and save it to a file, at which point it will be possible to ask the computer to perform math or combine statistic on any time range that has been previously input.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I hope to learn more about the basic functions we have already used, as well as the possibility of some new functions to increase functionality.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
I hope to use datetime, csv, math, and possibly pandas.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes. Some functions would include things to read existing data, create new data, and perform math on any combination of dates and times.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
Test functions will be created to ensure I am pulling correctly from the csv files.
